Hello! I am a PhD student at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by [Chenyan Xiong](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/). 

Previously, I finished my masters at CMU LTI where I was advised by [Maxine Eskenazi](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~max/index.html) and [Aaron Steinfeld](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/aaron-steinfeld/). During my masters, I investigated generalization in language models -- mostly in the realm of dialogue tasks. Before grad school, I spent time in industry working on machine learning and deep learning applications for natural language processing. Prior to that, I graduated with distinction from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) with a B.S. in [Computer 
Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) and [Mathematics](https://www.ubc.ca/).
