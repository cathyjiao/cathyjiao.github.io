Hello! I am an incoming PhD student at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). I recently finished my master's at CMU, where I was advised by [Maxine Eskenazi](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~max/index.html) and [Aaron Steinfeld](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/aaron-steinfeld/). 

During my masters, I investigated large language models capabilities for dialogue and interaction [[EMNLP '22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12673), [SIGDIAL '22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10918), [IWSDS '23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12004)]. Before grad school, I spent time in industry working on machine learning and deep learning applications for natural language processing. Prior to that, I graduated with distinction from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) with a B.S. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) and [Mathematics](https://www.ubc.ca/).
